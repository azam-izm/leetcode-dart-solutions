**LeetCode Problem 13: Roman to Integer**

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

| Symbol | Value |
|--------|-------|
| I      | 1     |
| V      | 5     |
| X      | 10    |
| L      | 50    |
| C      | 100   |
| D      | 500   |
| M      | 1000  |

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

• `I` can come before `V` (5) and `X`(10) → 4, 9 <br>
• `X` can come before `L` (50) and `C` (100) → 40, 90 <br>
• `C` can come before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) → 400, 900 

**Examples:** <br>
• Input: "III" → Output: 3 <br>
• Input: "LVIII" → Output: 58 (L=50, V=5, III=3) <br>
• Input: "MCMXCIV" → Output: 1994 (M=1000, CM=900, XC=90, IV=4) 

**Constraints:**  <br>
1 <= s.length <= 15  <br>
Valid characters: I, V, X, L, C, D, M  <br>
Valid Roman numeral in range [1, 3999]
